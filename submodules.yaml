# Submodule configuration with sparse checkout support
# Usage: make setup-submodules
#
# Submodules with sparse checkout only include specified paths/files.
# Submodules without sparse config clone the entire repo.
#
# Sparse checkout options:
#   paths: Array of paths (can be strings or objects)
#     - Simple string: includes entire directory and all contents recursively
#     - Object with 'path' and 'files': includes only specified files from that directory
#   mode: 'cone' (includes root files) or 'no-cone' (strict)
#
# Example:
#   sparse:
#     mode: no-cone
#     paths:
#       - charts/rules                    # entire directory
#       - charts/dashboards/grafana       # another entire directory
#       - path: config/workspaces         # specific files only
#         files:
#           - staging.tfvars.json
#           - prod.tfvars.json
#
# Notes:
#   - Individual file checkout requires mode: no-cone
#   - A directory entry includes all files within it, so file entries
#     under the same directory are redundant (but harmless)
